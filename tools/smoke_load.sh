#!/usr/bin/env bash
# smoke_load.sh — pre-release gate: prove the plugin actually LOADS, not just that it validates.
#
# `claude plugin validate` and `claude plugin details` both check the manifest/inventory but do NOT
# reproduce session-start load errors — the "Duplicate hooks file detected" bug passed both and shipped
# in 0.1.0–0.1.2. This script adds two layers `validate` misses:
#
#   1. Static manifest hygiene (always runs, jq-only): encodes Claude Code's own rules — most importantly
#      that the manifest `hooks` key must NOT point at the standard hooks/hooks.json (it is auto-loaded;
#      referencing it again is the duplicate-hooks bug). This is the deterministic catch for that class.
#   2. Live install+load (runs when `claude` is available): installs the plugin into a throwaway config
#      dir and asserts the component inventory loads with the expected skills/hooks and no error text.
#
# Usage: tools/smoke_load.sh [REPO]   (default: the repo this script lives in)
#        tools/smoke_load.sh --static-only [REPO]
