# Fast and deterministic: static shipped-path hygiene, static load smoke (no live plugin install),
# and the fixture-driven hook behavior tests. This is what .claude/harness.json points test_command
# at, and what a pre-push hook should run. The FULL live load smoke (tools/smoke_load.sh with `claude`
# on PATH) is the separate pre-release check.
