# Stop hook — verification gate, stack-agnostic.
#
# When a turn ends with implementation code changed (per the stack profile's impl_dirs), it RUNS the
# project's canonical test_command and BLOCKS if it fails — a red test is a fact, not a judgment, so
# it is safe to block on. It also reminds (advisory) when a UI/impl change shipped without an
# operator-journey test. Inert unless components.verification_gate is true in .claude/harness.json.
#
# Enforcement posture: a test_command failure BLOCKS by default (locked decision — Layer-0 checks are
# deterministic). Adopters rolling out gradually can downgrade to warn-only by creating
# .claude/.verification-warn (a failure is then surfaced but does not block). The operator-test check
# is always advisory — it is a heuristic, not a pass/fail.
#
# Stop-hook mechanics (verified against the hooks guide): exit 2 prevents the stop and continues the
# conversation so Claude addresses the gap; exit 0 lets the turn end. The stop_hook_active guard keeps
# a block from looping. (Whether exit-2 stderr is shown to the model is not spelled out in the docs;
# the block/continue itself is — the enforcement does not depend on the message being surfaced.)
#
# NOTE: the old .claude/.last-review "was it reviewed?" check was removed — it compared a model-written
# marker to HEAD and could not tell a real review from a claimed one. A real review gate returns backed
# by a reviewer artifact (harness roadmap phase 3).
